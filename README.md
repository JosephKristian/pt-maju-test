## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to deliver a pixel-perfect, fully responsive homepage that matches the Figma design with high fidelity, ensuring:

- Exact typography, colors, spacing, and layout  
- Mobile-first and responsive design for multiple device widths  
- Clean and reusable component structure  
- Subtle hover and motion effects to enhance user experience without compromising design accuracy  

---

## Technology Stack

- React.js (with Vite as the build tool) for fast development and hot module replacement  
- Tailwind CSS for efficient styling and responsiveness  
- Framer Motion (optional) for smooth, elegant animations and hover effects  
- Accessibility and SEO best practices considered  

---

## How I Built the Homepage

- Components structured per section matching Figma layout  
- Responsive Tailwind utility classes with breakpoints aligned to design specs  
- Subtle scroll and hover animations using Framer Motion for user engagement  
- Optimized images with proper alt attributes for accessibility  
- Semantic HTML tags applied for SEO benefits

## WordPress Implementation Proposal

If this website were to be built on WordPress, I would implement the following **Custom Post Types (CPT)** and **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)** to ensure flexibility, scalability, and ease of content management:

### Custom Post Types (CPT)

- **Property**  
  For property listings: price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, status, images, location, etc.

- **Team Member**  
  For the team section: name, role, photo, bio, social links.

- **Service**  
  For services offered: title, description, icon/image.

- **New Arrival**  
  For highlighting new properties or offers with images and descriptions.

### Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)

- **Repeater Fields**  
  For galleries, multiple images, or social links.

- **Flexible Content**  
  For modular homepage sections editable by content managers.

- **Relationship Fields**  
  To link posts such as properties to agents or services to teams.

- **Options Pages**  
  For global settings like contact info, footer content, and site-wide banners.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies  
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server  
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Final Notes

I have prioritized pixel-perfect accuracy and responsiveness in the homepage slice. Hover effects were added to enrich the UI while respecting the original design language. The proposed CPT and ACF structure provides a solid foundation for a scalable, easily manageable WordPress backend.
